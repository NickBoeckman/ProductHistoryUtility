Group: Product History Utility

1) Explain how you were involved in the group.

  I was mainly involved in creating the prototype of the system for this project. I also did alot of the editing and
  revising on the different documents.

2) What did you specifically contribute to the group? Not, how did you help someone else. 

	My sepcific contribution to the group was creating the working prototype for assignment one. I also helped work with
	the documentation but mostly just helped edit what Nick and David where doing.

3) What would you like me to specifically grade you on because you feel that it is most representative of your work? 

	I think the system prototype would be the most represintitve of my work for this assignment.

4) How did you coordinate your group activities between the various components? 

	Group activities were divided up into small portions. Each of us has different strenghts and weaknesses. We mostly 
	collaborated via google docs.

5) What were your experiences and difficulties with this assignment? 

	I think our main struggles where with the dataflow diagram no one in our group had a lot of experince making DFD's 
	however with a combination of advice from the Professor and David's hard work I think we have come up with a good DFD.

6) What are you going to do differently next assignment to overcome these difficulties? 

  I think we may want to try and approach DFD's in a different direction next time. Instead of creating the DFD and then 
  decomposing it, we should try writing the decompisition first and then creating a dfd of that.
