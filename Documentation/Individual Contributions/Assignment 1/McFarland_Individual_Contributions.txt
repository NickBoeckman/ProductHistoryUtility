Name: Zachary McFarland
Group: SPDX Productization.
1) Explain how you were involved in the group.
For this assignment I have sort of become the liaison for communication to other groups.

2) What did you specifically contribute to the group? Not, how did you help someone else.
I also initially created this document and created the github repository.

3) What would you like me to specifically grade you on because you feel that it is most representative of your work?
For this assignment I think I have mostly been working on communication and getting a an work environment up and running. I also created the DB diagram.

4) How did you coordinate your group activities between the various components?
We have been using google docs to do all of our collaboration in this specific assignment.

5) What were your experiences and difficulties with this assignment?
I feel we still really don’t have a solid grasp on what the scope of the SPDX Productization project is.

6) What are you going to do differently next assignment to overcome these difficulties?
I think once we start actually developing the software we can really get a feel for what is required. Also we may want to talk to the SPDX community to see what their wants/needs are.
