1) Explain how you were involved in the group.
Active participation; voicing ideas and opinions that were taken into consideration when establishing project goals and scope, as well as group expectations.

2) What did you specifically contribute to the group? Not, how did you help someone else.
I’ve made revisions to the charter and management plan, specifically, and the input I vocalized made it into several different sections of this assignment.

3) What would you like me to specifically grade you on because you feel that it is most representative of your work?
I honestly feel this was a strong group effort in that everyone had a say in everything that came to be. I guess if it’s a category, I’d like to be graded on just promoting and participating in a team environment that actually works together.

4) How did you coordinate your group activities between the various components?
Email to confirm meetings, Google docs to collaborate, and meetings to work in person when schedules worked.

5) What were your experiences and difficulties with this assignment?
Understanding and visualizing what our project needs to accomplish.

6) What are you going to do the differently next assignment to overcome these difficulties?
Clearing up expectations and goals among ourselves, class, and the professor.
