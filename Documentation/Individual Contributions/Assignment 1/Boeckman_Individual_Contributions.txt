Name: Nick Boeckman
Group: AIRS
1) Explain how you were involved in the group.
My main involvement with the group is the creation of the data flow diagram, and the discussions about the system and its requirements.

2) What did you specifically contribute to the group? Not, how did you help someone else.
On top of what I already listed above, I also suggested using Google Docs as a way we can all work on assignments such as this at the same time.

3) What would you like me to specifically grade you on because you feel that it is most representative of your work?
I feel its hard to pick something that is just representative of my work for this assignment because of the structure of this assignment. The data flow diagram would probably be the best choice for me specifically, even though the final drawing isn’t just mine.

4) How did you coordinate your group activities between the various components?
Our coordination has mainly been through email and Google Docs. We were able to have a proper meeting on January 28th, but because of weather were only able to correspond through Google Docs to get the assignment finished.

5) What were your experiences and difficulties with this assignment?
The most difficult part of this assignment was probably actually trying to figure out what the requirements of the system were, and how everything connects.

6) What are you going to do differently next assignment to overcome these difficulties?
I have a feeling that we are still missing some points for this system, mainly because we really don’t have as clear of a picture on what this specific component is to begin with. This should become more clear with time.
