Name: David Le
Group: Product History Utility

1) Explain how you were involved in the group.

	Taking an active part in discussions where goals are defined and descisions are made; for example, within our meetings, we agree on what needs to get done and who should do them - I volunteered to take over the rework of our original DFD submission. Additionally, we discuss and come to a consensus on different aspects and specifics of the assignment.


2) What did you specifically contribute to the group? Not, how did you help someone else. 

	The Data Flow Diagram and revisions throughout the document, mostly in the Charter and Description and the Community Management Plan.


3) What would you like me to specifically grade you on because you feel that it is most representative of your work? 

	The data flow diagram.


4) How did you coordinate your group activities between the various components? 

	Everyone volunteered to take care of separate parts of the assignment. When collaboration was necessary, we coordinated through email, Google Docs, class time, and meetings.


5) What were your experiences and difficulties with this assignment? 

	The data flow diagram is much more complicated than I initially envisioned.
	
	I'm not as familiar with the more technical side of developement.
 

6) What are you going to do differently next assignment to overcome these difficulties? 

	I'd like to try commenting the code to gain a better understanding of how things work behind the curtain.
