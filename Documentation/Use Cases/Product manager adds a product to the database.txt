1. Title: Product manager adds a product to the database.
2. Primary Actor: Product Manager
3. Goal in Context:
	1. To create a new product to associate different pieces of software with.
	2. To generate notice files for new products.
4. Stakeholders and Interests:
	1. Product Manager:
		1. To make sure that all code is documented for a new product.
		2. To keep track of each product as they are created.
		3. To adhere to license requirements when distributing packages.
	2. Customers:
		1. To know more about the product they are using
5. Preconditions:
	1. A new product has been created.
	2. The product being created has no previous versions.
	3. The product code needs to be documented for display to customers.
6. Main Success Scenario:
	1. Product has been successfully added to the database.
7. Failed End Condition:
	1. Not all pieces of information needed for a submission to the database were given.
	2. The product has no associated software or packages.
	3. The database cannot be accessed.
8. Trigger: A new product has been created and needs to be documented.
9. Notes: At the current time, it is unknown whether or not the product manager will have to associate any specific piece of software to a product when it is first created. This issue may therefore not be needed depending on the structure.
