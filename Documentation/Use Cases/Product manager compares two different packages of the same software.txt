	1. Product Manager:
		1. To know license differences between versions of packages and connect the correct version of software with a given package.
		2. To ensure compliance of licenses in their products.
	2. Internal Programmers:
		1. To know the version of each package they use in a product so they can make changes while adhering to license restrictions.
5. Preconditions:
	1. Each package is located in the database.
	2. Each package is a different revision of the same software.
6. Main Success Scenario:
	1. License changes are displayed and viewed through user interface.
7. Failed End Condition:
	1. Packages from two different pieces of software are selected.
	2. One of the packages given cannot be located in the database.
